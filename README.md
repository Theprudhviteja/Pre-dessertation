This text summarizes research on high-intensity, long-duration continuous auroral activity (HILDCAA) events, which are mainly attributed to interplanetary Alfvén waves generated by solar activity. Key points include:

1. **Cause of HILDCAA Events**: These events result from outward-propagating Alfvén wave trains from the Sun. The waves often, though not always, appear several days after significant solar events, such as shocks or solar wind density spikes.
  
2. **Mechanism of Energy Transfer**: Magnetic reconnection between the southward components of Alfvén wave magnetic fields and the Earth's magnetosphere facilitates energy transfer to the magnetosphere, fueling auroral activity.

3. **Relaxed Criteria for AE Events**: Less intense auroral activity events also correlate with interplanetary Alfvénic fluctuations, suggesting that a significant portion of auroral activity might be due to similar reconnection events.

4. **Criteria for Identifying HILDCAA Events**: Following Tsurutani and Gonzalez (1987), HILDCAA events are intervals of intense auroral activity with an AE index >1000 nT, lasting at least 2 days without AE falling below 200 nT for more than 2 hours. They can occur without a geomagnetic storm (Dst > −50 nT) or during a storm recovery phase.

5. **HILDCAA Event Data**: Hajra et al. (2013) cataloged 133 events from January 1975 to December 2011, later updated to 145 events through 2017. Three additional events from 2018–2020 bring the total to 148 for the 1975–2020 period.

6. **Storm Classification**: Storms are categorized by Dst index: moderate storms are marked by −50 nT ≥ Dst > −100 nT, while stronger storms have Dst ≤ −100 nT.
